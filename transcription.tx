It's so very nice to meet you!

Welcome to the world of Pokemon!

My name is Rowan.

However, everyone just calls me
the Pokemon Professor.

Before I go any further, is this
your first adventure?

If you need advice, I'm certainly
capable of giving it.

We humans live alongside Pokemon
as friends.

At times we play together,
and at other times we\l
work together.

Some people use their Pokemon
to battle and develop
closer bonds with them.

What do I do?

I conduct research so that we may
learn more about Pokemon.
